wow okay. Just walked out of Thudarum and my brain's still fizzing like soda left out in the sun. Popcorn crumbs EVERYWHERE, stuck to my jeans... and what was that sound? Jiminy cricket someone had their phone on the whole time. Anyway, this  —where to even start? The colors! Like a flamingo had an existential crisis on screen, just splashing around, but in a good way? Kind of like, if Salvador Dali did a collab with Pixar, acid-trip style but still grounded, somehow?  

> My back is aching from those seats, whew! But that last scene, with the protagonist staring at the sea, it echoed in my bones, like hearing an old song from middle school, half-forgotten but still moving. The waves like whispered secrets, the sky an endless canvas of regrets. It’s funny, someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for them and now I'm thinking they really need to just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   properly, you know? You gotta see these visuals on a big screen.

Oh and the dialogue, the part when they were arguing in the rain about truth and illusion, got me thinking of a time I lost my umbrella, and the rain felt like a thousand tiny hands pushing you forward, or pulling you back, depending. It felt like a storm, emotions swirling like a blender with no lid. 

There’s this moment—no spoilers—but kind of when the plot twists on itself, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat chase its tail till it’s dizzily satisfied, or confused. The theater was a mess, the noise mixing with the   in a sort of chaotic symphony. 

And there's this car chase no one told me about, it's more of an emotional car chase, you know? Like when you're late and every red light is the universe’s way of challenging your patience. It was like gravity got drunk and the rules went right out the window.

Anyway, I guess I'll talk later, my mind's still spiraling and I might go 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to dissect it at home.
